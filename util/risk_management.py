This file implements various risk management strategies for trading in financial markets. Each strategy is designed to mitigate different types of risks and enhance overall portfolio management. The implemented strategies include:

To-do strategies that can be added:
- Implementing more sophisticated risk management algorithms.
- Incorporating machine learning models for risk assessment.
